# Healthcare Cost & Utilization Analysis

This project analyzes hospital inpatient and Medicare datasets to uncover cost drivers, utilization patterns, and opportunities for efficiency in U.S. healthcare. By profiling and cleaning diagnosis/procedure frequency data across multiple years and combining it with Medicare provider/service datasets, the project highlights trends that can support policy decisions, hospital benchmarking, and cost savings strategies.

## [Executive Summary](https://github.com/Zennahby/MEDICARE_COST_UTILIZATION_ANALYSIS/blob/main/Executive%20Summary.md)

## Objectives

Identify the most resource-intensive diagnoses and procedures

Detect outliers and anomalies in frequency and cost patterns

Benchmark regional variations in care delivery and utilization

Provide insights to support efficient resource allocation
