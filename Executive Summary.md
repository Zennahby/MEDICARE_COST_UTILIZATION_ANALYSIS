# Executive Summary

Hospitals and insurers are under pressure from rising healthcare costs and differences in how care is delivered across regions. This project looks at five years of California inpatient data alongside Medicare hospital data to better understand what drives costs, how resources are used, and where savings can be made.

We combined and cleaned 19 large datasets to build one reliable source of information. With this, we were able to spot:

Procedures that are both common and expensive, showing where cost control can have the biggest impact.

Patterns in how hospitals use resources across regions and over time, helping leaders compare performance and plan more effectively.

Inconsistencies in diagnosis and procedure coding, which once fixed, make reporting and decision-making more accurate.

The results give hospitals, payers, and policymakers clear insights to guide better resource planning, fairer hospital comparisons, and smarter healthcare policies. In simple terms, this work shows how turning raw data into clear evidence can help improve care while controlling costs.
